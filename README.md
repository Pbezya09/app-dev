###OVERVIEW
>**20th Century Girl** is a 2022 South Korean coming-of-age romance drama film written and directed by Bang Woo-ri in her feature film debut. The film stars Kim Yoo-jung, Byeon Woo-seok, Park Jung-woo, and Roh Yoon-seo, and was released on Netflix on October 21, 2022.

>Set in 1999, the story follows Na Bo-ra (Kim Yoo-jung), a bright and loyal 17-year-old high school student. Her best friend, Kim Yeon-du (Roh Yoon-seo), is preparing to leave for the U.S. to undergo heart surgery. Before departing, Yeon-du confesses that she has fallen for a boy named Baek Hyun-jin (Park Jung-woo) and asks Bo-ra to keep an eye on him. Bo-ra agrees, promising to report back with details about his life.

>As Bo-ra begins her observations, she joins the school's broadcasting club to get closer to Hyun-jin. However, she soon realizes that she has been monitoring the wrong person due to a case of mistaken identity involving a swapped school jacket. The boy she has been following is actually Poong Woon-ho (Byeon Woo-seok), Hyun-jin's best friend. Unintentionally, Bo-ra finds herself falling for Woon-ho, who reciprocates her feelings.

>Upon Yeon-du's return, the truth about the mix-up surfaces, leading to emotional turmoil among the trio. Bo-ra, torn between her feelings for Woon-ho and her loyalty to Yeon-du, decides to suppress her emotions. Eventually, Yeon-du learns of Bo-ra and Woon-ho's mutual affection and, valuing their friendship, encourages Bo-ra to pursue her happiness.

>As Bo-ra and Woon-ho's relationship blossoms, Woon-ho reveals that he must return to New Zealand to reunite with his family. They part ways with promises to keep in touch and plans to reunite. However, communication from Woon-ho abruptly ceases, leaving Bo-ra heartbroken and confused.

>Years later, in 2019, Bo-ra receives an invitation to an art exhibition. There, she discovers that Woon-ho had passed away in an accident shortly after returning to New Zealand. The exhibition, organized by Woon-ho's younger brother, Joseph (Ong Seong-wu), features a heartfelt video Woon-ho had made, capturing their cherished moments together. This revelation provides Bo-ra with closure, allowing her to reflect on her first love with both sorrow and gratitude.
